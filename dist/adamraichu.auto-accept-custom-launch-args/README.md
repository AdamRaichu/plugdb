# Automatically Accept Custom Launch Arguments

Now that's a mouthful, isn't it?

Are you tired of seeing popups like this?

Me too! So I decided to make this simple plugin which will automatically confirm this popup.

**Disclaimer**: This plugin affects/interferes with a feature of steam designed to keep you safe. Use at your own risk, and only if you understand what you are doing.

In the future I plan to add options to allow/deny specific games or launch arguments.
